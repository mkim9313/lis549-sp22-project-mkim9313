            <h3>Interview</h3>
            <p>Our team conducted semi-structure interviews with a TSA agent and three frequent and non-frequent
                travelers.
                Each interview was around 60 minutes with a set of questions to find common emotions and actions flyers
                have
                during packing and going through a TSA security check. An interview with a TSA agent also provided a
                different perspective to the issues that are less aware of. </p>

            <h3>Experience Problem</h3>
            <p>In order to improve the experience, it is critical to define the root cause of the problem. To do so, our
                team used the <em> 5 Whys </em> method, peeling down layers of symptoms to reach the root cause of the
                problem. We
                realized that airlines and travel agencies are less involved after travelers book their tickets.
                Infrequent travelers are not fully informed with the TSA screening process and don’t always check the
                TSA website for further information. </p>

            <h3>The 5 Why's</h3>
            <p>Travelers often feel stressed or stressed at the TSA screening checkpoint<br><br>
                <em>WHY?</em>They are feared of getting their items confiscated or flagged by the officers<br>
                <em>WHY?</em>They are not sure with what items are prohibited<br>
                <em>WHY?</em>They don't get informed on the TSA guidelines unless they check by themselves<br>
                <em>WHY?</em>Booking agencies don't inform their customers<br>
                <em>WHY?</em>The service does not include shaping customers' experience before or at the airport​
