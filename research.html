    <h2>Research</h2>

    <h3>Interview</h3>
    <p>Our team conducted semi-structure interviews with a TSA agent and three frequent and non-frequent travelers. Each interview was around 60 minutes with a set of questions to find common emotions and actions flyers have during packing and going through a TSA security check. An interview with a TSA agent also provided a different perspective to the issues that are less aware of.  </p>

    <h3>Experience Problem</h3>
    <p>In order to improve the experience, it is critical to define the root cause of the problem. To do so, our team used the 5 Whys method, peeling down layers of symptoms to reach the root cause of the problem. We realized that airlines and travel agencies are less involved after travelers book their tickets. Infrequent travelers are not fully informed with the TSA screening process and donâ€™t always check the TSA website for further information. </p>
