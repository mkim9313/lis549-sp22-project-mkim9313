                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever felt anxious waiting in the line to pass through TSA screening? Have you ever
                        experienced
                        your items being confiscated due to standard security procedures? Airlines and travel agencies
                        are
                        less
                        involved after travelers book their tickets. For infrequent travelers, the lack of guidance
                        post-booking
                        may lead to feelings of insecurity while packing and going through the TSA, frustration if they
                        were
                        not
                        informed of important security guidelines and embarrassment if they are singled out for
                        confiscation.
                        <br><br>This project was intended to design an experience of packing and getting ready for a
                        trip after
                        booking
                        a flight ticket. Pack with Us assists flyers by providing a personalized packing checklist based
                        on
                        their locational data and user information.
