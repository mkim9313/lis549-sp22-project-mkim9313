    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Have you ever felt anxious waiting in the line to pass through TSA screening? Have you ever experienced your items being confiscated due to standard security procedures? Airlines and travel agencies are less involved after travelers book their tickets. For infrequent travelers, the lack of guidance post-booking may lead to feelings of insecurity while packing and going through the TSA, frustration if they were not informed of important security guidelines and embarrassment if they are singled out for confiscation. This project was intended to design an experience of packing and getting ready for a trip after booking a flight ticket. Pack with Us assists flyers by providing a personalized packing checklist based on their locational data and user information.</p>

    <em>Packing for your trip and going through TSA should be as frictionless as reciting your favorite Chipotle order.</em>
