        <div>
            <h3>Limitation</h3>
            <p>Our design had to be feasible within the context of our organization and environment. TSA has a strict
                security guideline that cannot be easily changed and every airport has different structures, making it
                impossible for our team to redesign the airport environment or the security screening process.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Voice AI</h3>
            <p>Packing for a trip can be a busy process that requires moving around the house and continuously using
                both hands. Our team integrated a voice AI in the service so the travelers can easily use the service
                while packing without having to use their hands more. They can simply use their voice -cased digital
                assistant such as Siri or Alexa while packing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>As usual, travelers will book flights through travel agency. For this use case, we used Expedia as
                    it is a common travel agency that is used by millions of people over the world. </li>
                <li>After booking, travelers get a confirmation email where they can find an information about the Pack
                    With Us service. They can opt in to use the service and take a quick survey that is later used in
                    the smart packing list.</li>
                <li>Travelers get a personalized packing list. </li>
                <li>While packing travelers use the voice-based service and check what they need to pack, things to
                    consider, and tips for TSA screening. </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
