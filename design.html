    <h2>Design</h2>

    <h3>limitation</h3>
    <p>Our design had to be feasible within the context of our organization and environment. TSA has a strict security guideline that cannot be easily changed and every airport has different structures, making it impossible for our team to redesign the airport environment or the security screening process.</p>

    <h3>Voice AI</h3>
    <p>Packing for a trip can be a busy process that requires moving around the house and continuously using both hands. Our team integrated a voice AI in the service so the travelers can easily use the service while packing without having to use their hands more. They can simply use their voice -cased digital assistant such as Siri or Alexa while packing.</p>

    <h3>Use Case Scenario</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>As usual, travelers will book flights through travel agency. For this use case, we used Expedia as it is a common travel agency that is used by millions of people over the world. </li>
            <li>After booking, travelers get a confirmation email where they can find an information about the Pack With Us service. They can opt in to use the service and take a quick survey that is later used in the smart packing list.</li>
            <li>Travelers get a personalized packing list. </li>
            <li>While packing travelers use the voice-based service and check what they need to pack, things to consider, and tips for TSA screening. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
